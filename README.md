Welcome to the (unusually long named)
# Fundamental principles in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Biostatistics
A class that is part of the Molecular Biomedicine MSc Program.
Course Structure
9(+1) Lectures on topics related to computational and statistical approaches of molecular/biomedical problems
Readings to be performed BEFORE each class (You have been warned)
Topics and questions to be discussed in class
Final evaluation will consist of written essay(s) and an (old-fashioned) in-class oral test.
Course Objectives
- Broad Picture: To remind you stuff you have chosen to forget after convincing you they were relevant all along. [Analytical thinking, quantitative approaches, statistical inference]
- Concepts: To give you an overview of the problems solved by computational and algorithmic approaches in modern biomedicine.
- Skillset: To show you how to perform (but more importantly how to interpret) standard bioinformatics analyses on genomic data.[Gene Expression, Functional Analysis, Modeling of biological data]

### Assignment(s)
 * Find a scientific paper of your interest that contains computational analysis. Break down its components into understanding what is the main question, which technique is used to obtain the measurements, how are they analyzed and what sort of mathematics/statistics principles were used in their interpretation. 
 * Prepare to present this in a flash talk in class (no powerpoint needed).

## 2. [Part Ib. Problems that require computation "-omics" Approaches to Biology](https://github.com/christoforos-nikolaou/MolBioMedClass/blob/master/Part_Ib_Computation_and_omics_approaches_to_Biology.md) (Nov 4th 2022)
* Class will start with the presentations of the first assignment (see above) and discussion.
* Computation in biomedical problems. We will break down the types of data that we may come up against. These fall into the following broad categories
  - Problems of difference/distance/similarity
  - Problems related to variability
  - Problems that deal with serial data
  - Problems that require/allow modeling
* At a second level we will discuss the basic concepts of computation. In particular how we will:
  - Use flowcharts and pseudocode to describe a computational pipeline
  - Employ optimization techniques
  - Describe logical relationships

 * The notions of samples and populations
 * Descriptive statistics such as the mean and the median values
 * How we compare the means of two samples
 * How we interpret comparisons outcomes
 * How we calculate distances and similarities between numerical values
 * How we may use these distances to group individuals/items in clusters

## 5. Part IIIa. [Variability and Information. In statistics and Data Science](https://rpubs.com/ChristoforosNikolaou/MBioMedPtIIIa) (Nov 25th 2022)
Comparing means makes sense only up to one level. Samples and populations are variable and this variability is to be taken into account. In this class we will discuss issues related to variability and how it is strongly linked to the concept of information. The main points at this stage are
 * Measures of data dispersion: range, variance and standard deviation
 * Comparing variability in samples
 * Comparing samples, using variance. Analysis of Variance
 * Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
 * K-means Clustering

Variability lies at the heart of a number of biological phenomena from genomic variation, to cell populations. In this class we will discuss how we go about to study and exploit variability in numerous contexts. In particular:
* We will see how genomic variability may be linked to phenotypic characteristics and provide valuable information in the study of mendelian as well as complex diseases
* We will see how variation in sequences may be quantified in order to assess the regulatory potential of particular sequences
* We will visualize and quantify variability in many dimensions as the product of state-of-the-art single-cell genomics analyses

## 7. Part IVa. Correlation, Regression and Causation. In statistics (Dec 9th 2022)
The ultimate goal in the study of physical phenomena is to reveal quantifiable relationships between properties. The first step towards this is the observation of correlation. Correlation is a statistical property that links two (or more) properties but may be generalized in models, which may be used to predict future events. In this class we will see how we can quantify the relationships between two or more properties and how, depending on the types of values they take, we need to distinguish between the following types of analyses:
 * Relationships between categorical values in contingency tables
 * Correlations between numerical values that are paired
At a next level we will see how we can draw from such relationships to build predictive models of regression and classification.

## 9. Recap, Projects and Evaluation (Dec 22nd 2021)
This (final) class will be devoted to clarifying concepts, a general recap and discussion of your final projects, the proposal of which you will have to prepare and present in class. Projects may be collaborative but it is important that they put to practice the skills you have acquired during the semester.

## 10. Final Projects Presentation and Discussion (Dec 23rd, 2021)
A day will be devoted to the final presentation of your projects.
A few notes from your interviews from Week #1 can be found [here](https://github.com/christoforos-nikolaou/MolBioMedClass/blob/master/Interview-Notes.md)
