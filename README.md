Final evaluation will consist of written essay(s) and an (old-fashioned) in-class oral test.
Course Objectives

- Broad Picture: To remind you stuff you have chosen to forget after convincing you they were relevant all along. [Analytical thinking, quantitative approaches, statistical inference]
- Concepts: To give you an overview of the problems solved by computational and algorithmic approaches in modern biomedicine.
- Skillset: To show you how to perform (but more importantly how to interpret) standard bioinformatics analyses on genomic data.[Gene Expression, Functional Analysis, Modeling of biological data]

## 1. [Part Ia. Introduction. Basic Concepts in Statistics and Informatics for bioscience](https://github.com/christoforos-nikolaou/MolBioMedClass/blob/master/Classes_2022/Part_Ia_Introductory_Concepts.md) (Oct 31st 2025)

This weeks class is an introduction to the concepts we will be discussing throughout the semester. Namely:

* Statistics and Informatics
* What do we need it for
* What it may refer to
* What it actually is
* Remembering stuff (from high-school)
* How to measure things
* How to assess/compare/interpret measurements
* **Some tasks**  
   Check out some of the plots and diagrams at the very end of the slide deck. Are you familiar with them? Have you seen them before in papers or textbooks? Try and think what each element in them represents and then consider alternative ways to represent the same data.

### Practical: Introduction to R Programming Language and Environment

* In this class we will get started with R as a programming language and Rstudio as our Integrated Development Environment (IDE) of choice.
* You may find a slide presentation for an R Basics Introduction [here](https://github.com/christoforos-nikolaou/MolBioMedClass/blob/master/Presentations/ModuleIntroR.pdf)
* A html file with more details and code that you can popy-paste to your own environments may be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/jgddiowy0k51kjqt6ksnf/R_introduction.html?rlkey=enzdh02olvz9god2b5o61ifzi&st=5wo1b9f6&dl=0). (It's safer to download the file and open it in the browser of your choice)
* We will use a hands on approach to see how we can start using R to describe problems, analyze them numerically and interpret the results.
* We will use [this file](https://github.com/christoforos-nikolaou/MolBioMedClass/blob/master/RMarkdown/Practicals_2024/R_practical_01_introduction.rmd).
* For today we will be also needing [this data file](https://github.com/christoforos-nikolaou/MolBioMedClass/blob/master/Datasets/bballshots.txt)

## 3. [Part IIa. Similarity and Distance. Statistics](https://rpubs.com/ChristoforosNikolaou/MBioMedPtIIa) (Nov 14th 2025)

Perhaps the most common types of analyses have to do with comparing things. In this class we will discuss ways to compare measurements, quantities from samples and populations. In particular we will discuss:

* The notions of samples and populations
* Descriptive statistics such as the mean and the median values
* How we compare the means of two samples
* How we interpret comparisons outcomes
* How we calculate distances and similarities between numerical values
* How we may use these distances to group individuals/items in clusters

## 5. Part IIIa. [Variability and Information. In statistics and Data Science](https://rpubs.com/ChristoforosNikolaou/MBioMedPtIIIa) (Nov 28th 2025)

Comparing means makes sense only up to one level. Samples and populations are variable and this variability is to be taken into account. In this class we will discuss issues related to variability and how it is strongly linked to the concept of information. The main points at this stage are

* Measures of data dispersion: range, variance and standard deviation
* Comparing variability in samples
* Comparing samples, using variance. Analysis of Variance
* Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
* K-means Clustering

Variability lies at the heart of a number of biological phenomena from genomic variation, to cell populations. In this class we will discuss how we go about to study and exploit variability in numerous contexts. In particular:

* We will see how genomic variability may be linked to phenotypic characteristics and provide valuable information in the study of mendelian as well as complex diseases
* We will see how variation in sequences may be quantified in order to assess the regulatory potential of particular sequences
* We will visualize and quantify variability in many dimensions as the product of state-of-the-art single-cell genomics analyses

## 8. Part IVa. Correlation, Regression and Causation. In statistics. (Dec 5th 2025)

The ultimate goal in the study of physical phenomena is to reveal quantifiable relationships between properties. The first step towards this is the observation of correlation. Correlation is a statistical property that links two (or more) properties but may be generalized in models, which may be used to predict future events. In this class we will see how we can quantify the relationships between two or more properties and how, depending on the types of values they take, we need to distinguish between the following types of analyses:

* Relationships between categorical values in contingency tables
* Correlations between numerical values that are paired
   At a next level we will see how we can draw from such relationships to build predictive models of regression and classification.

## 9. Recap, Projects and Evaluation (Dec 19th 2025)

This (final) class will be devoted to clarifying concepts, a general recap and discussion of your final projects, the proposal of which you will have to prepare and present in class. Projects may be collaborative but it is important that they put to practice the skills you have acquired during the semester.

## 10. Final Projects Presentation and Discussion (TBA)

A day will be devoted to the final presentation of your projects.
