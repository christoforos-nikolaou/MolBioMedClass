## Course Structure
* 9 Lectures on topics related to computational and statistical approaches of molecular/biomedical problems
* Readings to be performed BEFORE each class. (https://github.com/christoforos-nikolaou/MolBioMedClass) _(You have been warned)_
* Topics and questions to be discussed in class
* Final evaluation will consist of written essay(s) and an in-class presentations.

## Course Objectives 
* Broad Picture: To remind you stuff you have chosen to forget after convincing you they were relevant all along. [Analytical thinking, quantitative approaches, statistical inference]
* Concepts: To give you an overview of the problems solved by computational and algorithmic approaches in modern biomedicine.
* Skillset: To show you how to perform (but more importantly how to interpret) standard bioinformatics analyses on genomic data.[Gene Expression, Functional Analysis, Modeling of biological data]

## Discussing skills
---

## Which skills? and for what?
* How many of your parents are working? 
* What do they do? 
* How long have they been doing it?
---

## What job would you want to do?
* For how long do you expect to be doing it, once you land it?
* Which skills do you think are required?
* How do you plan on acquiring them?
---

## In the biomedical sciences of yesteryear 
* Which do you consider the most important accomplishments in the field?
* Which bioscientists do you admire (if any) and for which achievement?
* What made them great? Which skills did they possess that made them stand out? 
---

## In the biomedical sciences of today
* Which do you consider to be the most important problems and open questions?
* What do you think it will take to solve them?
---

## A note on obsolescence 
* Which problems that made people great,famous and admirable would still be relevant today had it not been for them?
* Which of the problems that you consider important, you think will still be relevant in 10,20,50 years from now?
---

## Which skill do you need to possess/acquire to become a good scientist?
* Which of them are innate and which are transferable?
* Which are important and which you can forget about?
* Which ones are permanent and will stick with you and which you will need to update?
---

## Lets break them down a bit
* Theory, information, knowledge skills (the stuff you get from textbooks, lectures, papers)
* Methods (the stuff you get from working at the bench, doing internships)
* What else?
---

## Which qualities do you consider *essential* for a scientist?
[comment]: <> (* analytical thinking, causal reasoning/deduction)
[comment]: <> (* spotting patterns, estimation/inference) 
[comment]: <> (* flexibility)
[comment]: <> (* interdisciplinarity)
[comment]: <> (* **creativity**)
---

## What about **creativity**
* Even wondered how the word has been reserved for the arts? 
* Do you think a scientist needs to be creative? in what way?
* Can you remember an instance in your (short) career when you yourselves were creative? What was that? Where did you _dig_ to get creativity out of?
* What helps you become inspired in science? How do you come up with original ideas?

## A small project: Interview a scientist
* Choose a scientist from the program. This could be a PI, a Professor or an executive in a company. But (s)he *must* have a scientific background.
* Ask her/him the set of questions we discussed above. You may focus more on:
  * The career path (degrees, PhD, possible change of topic)
  * His/her research work. What does she/he take more pride in? What does she/he condiser her/his major achievements?
  * What does she/he consider her big breakthrough in science. How did it happen or how did she/he _make_ it happen?
* Once the interview is over read the answers and try to think:
  * Are the things that he/she did still relevant today?
  * How fast would the things he/she described done today? Are they performed faster? (intensity)
  * Are they still relevant or perhaps even wrong (i.e. refuted by later works)? (obsolesence)
  * Are they still clever?
