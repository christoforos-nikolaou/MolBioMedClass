### General trends

* Most interviewees value some rather common skills as extremely important. Patience, resilience and generally being "tough" is what matters more. "Passion" in the general sense of the term, also ranks high
* Only one mentions curiosity (for me it would be an obvious first, next to being easily bored)
* Most people take pride in some specific accomplishment that provides "status update" (getting published, become a doctor, landing a job) but cannot recall a definite event/moment. 
* Those that can recall a specific moment or event are usually the youngest.
* Most people think of scientific creativity as a separate process from other forms of creation (like the arts, cooking or crafts), but are vague about the exact state they have in mind.
* Which ones did you spot?
